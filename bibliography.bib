There are drawbacks to all the explications, but a relatively acceptable one is available when the independent variables have a relevant, known ordering: consider the proportion of variance of the dependent variable linearly accounted for by the first independent variable; then consider the proportion of remaining variance linearly accounted for by the second independent variable; and so on. When, however, the independent variables do not have a relevant ordering, that approach fails. The primary suggestion of this article is to rescue the idea by averaging relative importance over all orderings of the independent variables. Variations and extensions of the idea are described.},

  abstract={Whenever multiple regression is used to test and compare theoretically motivated models, it is of interest to determine the relative importance of the predictors. Specifically, researchers seek to rank order and scale variables in terms of their importance and to express global statistics of the model as a function of these measures. This article reviews the many meanings of importance of predictors in multiple regression, highlights their weaknesses, and proposes a new method for comparing variables: dominance analysis. Dominance is a qualitative relation defined in a pairwise fashion: One variable is said to dominate another if it is more useful than its competitor in all subset regressions. Properties of the newly proposed method are described and illustrated.}

Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. }

  abstract = {Abstract Regression analysis is one of the most-used statistical methods. Often part of the research question is the identification of the most important regressors or an importance ranking of the regressors. Most regression models are not specifically suited for answering the variable importance question, so that many different proposals have been made. This article reviews in detail the various variable importance metrics for the linear model, particularly emphasizing variance decomposition metrics. All linear model metrics are illustrated by an example analysis. For nonlinear parametric models, several principles from linear models have been adapted, and machine-learning methods have their own set of variable importance methods. These are also briefly covered. Although there are many variable importance metrics, there is still no convincing theoretical basis for them, and they all have a heuristic touch. Nevertheless, some metrics are considered useful for a crude assessment in the absence of a good subject matter theory.

  abstract = {Many users of regression methods are attracted to the notion that it would be valuable to determine the relative importance of independent variables. This article demonstrates a method based on hierarchies that builds on previous efforts to decompose R2 through incremental partitioning. The standard method of incremental partitioning has been to follow one order among the many possible orders available. By taking a hierarchical approach in which all orders of variables are used, the average independent contribution of a variable is obtained and an exact partitioning results. Much the same logic is used to divide the joint effect of a variable. The method is general and applicable to all regression methods, including ordinary least squares, logistic, probit, and log-linear regression. A validation test demonstrates that the algorithm is sensitive to the relationships in the data rather than the proportion of variability accounted for by the statistical model used.},
