% Explain how we generate the data

% Explain how the simulation was conducted, i.e. structure of different datasets(covariance and coefficients)

% Explain the formulation of the theoretical correct answers

% How do we visualize the findings?

% How do the results compare to the analytic answers? Get some input from Steffi here.

% Provide perhaps the Gelman R2 value for each simulation and plot the distribution?
